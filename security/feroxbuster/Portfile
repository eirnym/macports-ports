description         A simple, fast, recursive content discovery tool written in Rust.


long_description    feroxbuster is a tool designed to perform Forced Browsing. \
                    Forced browsing is an attack where the aim is to enumerate and access  \
                    resources that are not referenced by the web application, but are still accessible by an attacker. \
                    feroxbuster uses brute force combined with a wordlist to search for unlinked \
                    content in target directories. These resources may store sensitive \
                    information about web applications and operational systems, such as \
                    source code, credentials, internal network addressing, etc... \
                    This attack is also known as Predictable Resource Location, \
                    File Enumeration, Directory Enumeration, and Resource Enumeration.
